There is one more thing regarding the helm controller
We are following:
- deployment: https://github.com/k3s-io/helm-controller/blob/master/manifests/deploy-namespaced.yaml (commit: 4fd20264a4b3b7bf910c3c5db6a3c67d1837e58d)
- namespace: https://github.com/k3s-io/helm-controller/blob/master/manifests/deploy-namespaced.yaml (commit: 4fd20264a4b3b7bf910c3c5db6a3c67d1837e58d)
- crds: https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/philippwaller/helm-controller (commit: ac67383a24e513de7917bd10f9b2d26347395434)

> The k3s-io helm-controller repository proudly mentions that it's k3s sandboxed, whatever that means, but forgets to add the crds for at least a year... Shall we try to get sandboxed too?
